            <p>I am Abdul Muyeed, currently in my third year pursuing a Bachelor's degree at the University of Rajshahi. I am passionate about both technology and problem-solving, and I strive to balance my academics with extra-curricular activities. Competitive programming has become one of my main interests, as it allows me to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, manageable tasks.</p>
         
            <p>I actively participate in programming competitions and hackathons, where I've sharpened my skills and gained recognition. I’m proficient in C++ and Java, and have completed several projects using these languages. In addition, I have experience with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, making me a versatile full-stack developer.</p>
         
            <p>I love learning new things and adapt quickly to new technologies. As a team player, I enjoy collaborating with others, and I’ve also demonstrated leadership skills by participating in, organizing, and volunteering for various national-level events.</p>
         
            <p>My personal motto is to improve a little every day, and I strive to learn something new each day. Beyond the tech world, I am passionate about traveling, particularly hiking and trekking. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and engaging in spontaneous conversations with people from all walks of life.</p>
